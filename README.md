# Custom Extensions

This repository contains all custom extensions developed by Marten Mrfc for the Minecraft plugin **Typewriter**.

## SimplifiedQuesting

Typewriter's questing system is incredibly flexible, offering endless possibilities. However, that flexibility often comes at the cost of time. Especially when creating simple, repetitive tasks like "kill X mobs" or similar objectives.

To solve this, I created the **SimplifiedQuesting** extension. It adds a set of entries that make quest creation way faster and easier:

* `BreakBlockObjective`
* `BreedMobObjective`
* `CatchFishObjective`
* `CraftObjective`
* `EnchantObjective`
* `GatherObjective`
* `KillEntityObjective`
* `PlaceBlockObjective`
* `TravelDistanceObjective`
